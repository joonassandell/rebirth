## Core idea

Rebirth provides you with a solid architectural baseline with predefined HTML, CSS, Template and JavaScript files upon which to rewrite your own design system. A newly created project instance is always unique and intended to be overridden by the project design requirements. Inspired strongly by methods and ideas from sources such as [SUIT CSS](https://github.com/suitcss/suit), [BEM](https://bem.info/), [INUITCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/), [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

## Installation

Rebirth works together with [Rebirth Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/joonasy/generator-rebirth.git):

{{#> code lang="shell"}}
$ npm install -g yo && npm install -g generator-rebirth@beta
{{/code}}

See [requirements](/docs/getting-started/requirements/), learn about the [generator](/docs/getting-started/generator/), read the [styleguide](/styleguide/) and finally create your first [project](/docs/getting-started/generator/#create-project):

{{#> code lang="shell"}}
$ yo rebirth [my-new-project-directory] --project=my-project-type
{{/code}}
