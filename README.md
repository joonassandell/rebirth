# Rebirth

> Combined styleguide and starter kit for new web projects (TYPO3/WordPress and Html).

Rebirth contains methods and ideas from various sources such as [BEM](https://bem.info/), [HTML5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), [INUITCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/), [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) and [SUIT CSS](https://github.com/suitcss/suit). By default this template supports IE11+, Mobile first -ideology and progressive enhancement.

Rebirth is **not a framework** but it contains predefined components and helpers that are meant to be modified based on your project needs.

## WORK IN PROGRESS!

Use only if you know what you are doing or you are working together with the author. All docs are currently very much outdated.

## Contribute

Please discuss about new ideas and things that you think should be modified. Currently all the styleguiding, components (CSS/JS) and generator logic has been made by Joonas Ylitalo [@joonasy](https://twitter.com/joonasy).
