# Rebirth

Hey, we're in development. Prior to reaching [v1.0.0](https://github.com/joonasy/rebirth/milestone/1).

Awesome front-end starter kit and opinionated styleguide for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Everytime you start a new project with Rebirth, recreate it to your project design. The idea behind Rebirth is not to be a framework but a starting point with predefined HTML, CSS and JavaScript recipes.

Inspired by methods and ideas from various sources such as [SUIT CSS](https://github.com/suitcss/suit), [BEM](https://bem.info/), [INUITCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/), [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

Correct way to use Rebirth is together with [Rebirth Yeoman generator](https://github.com/joonasy/generator-rebirth.git).

$ yarn global add generator-rebirth@beta
